# Black-Scholes Option Pricing Web App - Project Plan

## 🗓️ Timeline: ~1 Month (3–5 hours/day)

---

## ✅ Week 1: Foundation

- Review the Black-Scholes formula 📚
- Implement Python function for option pricing (Call & Put)
- Build a basic Streamlit app (text inputs + output)
- Set up Git workflow (frequent commits, proper messages)
- Write and polish README.md with project overview

---

## ✅ Week 2: Visualization + Greeks

- Calculate option Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho)
- Add visualizations (Matplotlib/Plotly/Streamlit Charts)
  - Price vs Volatility
  - Price vs Time to maturity
- Improve UI (better layout, styling, input forms)

---

## ✅ Week 3: Monte Carlo Simulation

- Implement Monte Carlo simulation for option pricing 🎲
- Let user choose between:
  - Analytical Black-Scholes
  - Monte Carlo Simulation
- Optimize performance (NumPy vectorization)
- Add convergence plots / histograms of simulated price paths

---

## ✅ Week 4: File Handling + Export + Documentation

- Add CSV upload for batch option pricing
- Enable download of results (CSV)
- Implement error handling & input validation
- Finalize project documentation:
  - Usage guide
  - Clear README sections
  - Example screenshots
- Update requirements.txt with final package list

---

## ✅ Optional Advanced Features (if time allows):

- Deploy app online (Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, etc.)
- Add unit tests for core calculation functions
- Include a live demo link in the README and your CV

---

## ✅ CV Description Sample:

> Built an interactive Black-Scholes option pricing web app with Monte Carlo simulation, option Greeks calculation, CSV input/output, and real-time visualization using Python and Streamlit.
